## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#load packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
library(writexl)
library(data.table)
library(networkD3)
library(tidyverse)
library(visNetwork)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(RColorBrewer)



#load data
data <- read_excel("Convocatorias_AVI_2018-2021.xlsx") %>%
  filter(Approved == 1)


  

#count the total number of projects
length(unique(data$ProjectTitle))

#count the total number of unique organizations
length(unique(data$Entity))

#count the number of projects per year
distinct_projects <- distinct(data, `ProjectTitle`, .keep_all=TRUE)
table(distinct_projects$`Year`)

#create an adjacency matrix
adj_matrix <- crossprod(table(select(data, c("ProjectTitle","Entity"))))
diag(adj_matrix) <- 0

edgelist <- as_edgelist(graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adj_matrix, mode="undirected", weighted=T))
ties <- length(as.data.frame(edgelist)[,1])

#visualize the network
network <- simpleNetwork(as.data.frame(edgelist), height="100px", width="100px", zoom=t)

saveNetwork(network, "AVI.html", selfcontained = TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
